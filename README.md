Project during the Spring 2017 semester at Rutgers University, for the Numerical Analysis class. 
Implements three numerical integration techniques: Trapezoidal, Simpson's, and Gauss-Legendre Quadrature (implemented for n = 2 and n = 3 sample points).
Further implements a least square method to measure the error of each.
All code is original.
